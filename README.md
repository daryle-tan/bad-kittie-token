## Bad Kittie Token

In this project I created an erc20 token that was deployed to the sepolia testnet. Here is the token contract address: 0x2b0696f9e23d50590DadAE1Ef7431c3DD4CC32A1

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
